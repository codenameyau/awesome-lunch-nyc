#### Garment District
- [Chicken House - 36th st, 7th & 8th](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chicken-house-new-york) - Vietnamese Takeout & Fried Chicken. Their ($7) Grilled Chicken Rice & Beans is my staple. Their ($6) Grilled Chicken Sandwich (Banh Mi) comes with a bountiful amount of chicken--it's a must-try. For more traditional cusine, try their ($6) House Special which comes with fries and 3 pieces of fried chicken--you can specifically ask for either leg or thigh. Alternatively, you can get the ($5) 2 Piece Fried Chicken With Rice and Beans, which is my quick one-minute-skip-the-line go-to.
- [Sushi Fussion - 35th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-fussion-of-nyc-new-york) - Kosher Sushi. Their sushi is infused with high quality ingredients and comes packaged with a generous amount of sauces--specials also come with a free drink. They're inside at the up-stairs floor in loading-dock--so be warned, there's no dining area. I always get the ($13) 3 Roll Combo, and recommend the Munchies Roll, the Rock&n Roll, and the Golden Roll. Lastly, you get a 10% discount when paying with cash.
- [GO! GO! Curry! - 38th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/go-go-curry-new-york) - Japanese Curry. One of my favorite lunch spots. If you haven't been there before, order their ($10) Home Run Katsu--it comes with white rice topped with brown curry, pork katsu, 1 tempura shrimp, 1 egg, and 1 sausage. If you go on any day that ends with a 5 (5, 15, 25), they will give you a free topping coupon.
- [El Sabroso - 37th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-sabroso-new-york) - Latin American. Get either the ($6) Baked Chicken or the ($6) Chicken Stew. Both meals come with a chicken leg and thigh, yellow rice, and beans topped with an amazing specialty home-made hot sauce.
- [Chef Yu - 36th st, 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-yu-new-york) - Chinese Cusine and Takeout. I definitely recommend dining in rather than takeout, you'll get roughly twice the food. Their lunch specials and soups vary around $9. I stand by their Spicy Diced Chicken with Baby Shrimp and Vegetable Fried Rice and their Everything Noodle Soup.
- [Cafe Bistro - 34th st, 8th & 9th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-market-place-new-york) - Sandwiches, Salads, Buffet. The food here is great and ranges from $7 to $10. The cafe is very spacious and lines are short.
- [Halal Cart - 35th, Broadway](http://www.yelp.com/) - Halal Food. One of the best Halal cart in the garment district. Ask for ($6) lamb-over-rice.

#### Hell's Kitchen
- [Golden City - 33rd & 34th st, 9th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-city-chinese-restaurant-new-york) - Chinese Takeout. Affordable chinese takeout in Midtown. It can get busy during lunch hours. Lunch specials are around $6 and comes with a drink. Definitely try out their ($7) Singapore Mei Fun.
- [Riko - 30th & 31st, 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/riko-peruvian-cuisine-new-york-2) - Peruvian Cuisine. Grab the ($6) half chicken--the meat is very moist and flavorful. I'd skip the rice and beans since the chicken is filling enough.
