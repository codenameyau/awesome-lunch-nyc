#### Chelsea
- [Golden City - 33rd & 34th st, 9th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-city-chinese-restaurant-new-york) - Chinese Takeout. Typical and affordable Chinese takeout--still it's the only decent Chinese takeout spot within miles. Lunch specials are around $6 and comes with a drink. If you're looking to try something new, order their ($7) Singapore Mei Fun. Lines can get busy during lunch hours, and you may find yourself waiting over 15 minutes just to get your food so I recommend coming here before 12PM or after 1:30PM to save yourself 10 minutes.
- [Riko's Peruvian Cusine - 30th & 31st, 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/riko-peruvian-cuisine-new-york-2) - Peruvian. Great spot for authentic Latin American food and rotisserie chicken. There's an EXCELLENT selection of dishes to choose from ranging from chicken, to beef, to seafood. Grab the ($7) half chicken--the meat is very moist and distinctly flavorful. I'd skip the rice and beans and just split a ($11) whole chicken and feast like a king.

#### Garment District
- [Chicken House - 36th st, 7th & 8th](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chicken-house-new-york) - Vietnamese Takeout & Fried Chicken. Their ($7) Grilled Chicken Rice & Beans is my staple. For first-timers, grab the ($6) Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which is the largest Banh Mi you can get in the city. For more traditional American cuisine, try their ($6) House Special which comes with fries and 3 pieces of fried chicken--you can specifically ask for either leg or thigh. Alternatively, you can get the ($5) 2 Piece Fried Chicken With Rice and Beans, which is my quick go-to if I want to skip the long lunch line.
- [Sushi Fussion - 35th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-fussion-of-nyc-new-york) - Kosher Sushi. Their sushi is made with high quality ingredients and comes packaged with a generous amount of wasabi and sauces--lunch specials also come with a free drink. They're inside at the up-stairs floor in loading-dock--so be warned, there's no dining area. Nonetheless, their sushi totally makes up for it; this is some of the best sushi combos you can get in the sushi with a huge selection of rolls, sushi, and sashimi. I always get the ($13) 3 Roll Combo, and recommend the Munchies Roll, the Rock&n Roll, and the Golden Roll. Lastly, you get a 10% discount when paying with cash.
- [GO! GO! Curry! - 38th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/go-go-curry-new-york) - Japanese Curry. One of my favorite lunch spots. If you haven't been there before, order their ($10) Home Run Katsu--it comes with white rice topped with brown curry, pork katsu, 1 tempura shrimp, 1 egg, and 1 sausage. If you go on any day that ends with a 5 (5, 15, 25), they will give you a free topping coupon.
- [El Sabroso - 37th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-sabroso-new-york) - Latin American. Get either the ($6) Baked Chicken or the ($6) Chicken Stew. Both meals come with a chicken leg and thigh, yellow rice, and beans topped with an amazing specialty home-made hot sauce. Recently, they've been serving smaller pieces of chicken to keep up with the increased demand, but I recommend trying this place if you want a quick meal without ever having to wait more than five minutes before getting your food.
- [Chef Yu - 36th st, 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-yu-new-york) - Chinese Cusine and Takeout. This is definitely the best Chinese sit-down spot in the area; they're skimpy with takeout portions, but for some reason they give double the amount of food for the same price when you sit in. Their lunch specials which cost around $9 each will be more than enough to fill you up. On colder days, try out one of their noodle soups--their ($9) Everything Noodle Soup is delicious. My staple here is the ($9) Spicy Diced Chicken with Baby Shrimp and Vegetable Fried Rice. If you want Chinese takeout, I'd recommend visiting Golden City instead, which is about 5 blocks away.
- [Cafe Bistro - 34th st, 8th & 9th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-market-place-new-york) - Sandwiches, Salads, and by-the-pound Buffet. The food here is great and beats out the other Cafes around the area by far. There's something for everyone here, and meals typically range from $7 to $10. It's a very spacious cafe with adequate seating and short lines. The hot and cold sandwiches here are spectacular.
- [Halal Cart - 35th, Broadway](http://www.yelp.com/) - Halal Food. Best Halal cart in the area out of the five I've tried.

#### Hell's Kitchen
- [Blossom Du Jour - 44th st, 9th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/blossom-on-columbus-new-york) - Vegan. Great spot for vegans and vegetarians with lunches ranging from $8 to $9. I'd recommend the ($9) Midtown Melt, ($9) Little Italy, and the ($8) Skyscraper Burger if you're feeling adventurous. I'd skip the salads here and recommend grabbing something at [Maoz](http://www.yelp.com/biz/maoz-vegetarian-new-york), [Green Symphony](http://www.yelp.com/biz/green-symphony-new-york), [Just Salad](http://www.yelp.com/biz/just-salad-new-york) instead. Avoid ordering anything greasy or oily since the sauce will easily leak through your container.

- [Taqueria Tehuitzingo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-tehuitzingo-new-york) - Mexican. This is the spot if you want ($3) delicious and very filling tacos. I'd avoid the $12 platters and stick to tacos.
