#### Garment District
- [Chicken House - 36th st, 7th & 8th](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chicken-house-new-york) - Vietnamese and Fried Chicken. Get the ($7) Vietnamese grilled chicken rice and beans, ($6) chicken Banh Mi aka. the grilled chicken sandwich, the ($6) House special which comes with fries and 3 pieces of fried chicken--you can ask specifically for either leg or thigh. Alternatively, you can get ($5) 2 pieces of fried chicken with rice and beans.
- [Sushi Fussion - 35th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-fussion-of-nyc-new-york) - Kosher Sushi. They offer amazing sushi that is surprisingly fresh and well made. The location is inside a loading-dock so there's no seating. You should definitely grab the ($13) 3 roll combo--I usually get the munchies roll, rock&n roll, and golden roll. It comes with free soda, and you get a 10% discount when paying with cash. Always ask for a combo up-front.
- [GO! GO! Curry! - 38th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/go-go-curry-new-york) - Japanese Curry. Get the ($10) Home Run Katsu which comes with white rice, non-spicy curry, pork katsu, tempura shrimp, egg, and sausage. If you go on any day that ends with a 5 (5, 15, 25), they will give you a free topping coupon.
- [El Sabroso - 37th st, 7th & 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-sabroso-new-york) - Latin American. Get either the ($6) baked chicken or the ($6) chicken stew. It comes with yellow rice and beans with an amazing hot sauce.
- [Chef Yu - 36th st, 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chef-yu-new-york) - Chinese Cusine and Takeout. When dining in, you'll get roughly twice the food and half the rice. Lunch specials are around $9. I definitely recommend the spicy diced chicken with baby shrimp and vegetable fried rice. Their soups are also very thick and flavorful.
- [Cafe Bistro - 34th st, 8th & 9th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-market-place-new-york) - Sandwiches, Salads, Buffet. The food here is great and ranges from $7 to $10. The cafe is very spacious and lines are short.
- [Halal Cart - 35th, Broadway](http://www.yelp.com/) - Halal Food. Best Halal cart in the garment district. Ask for ($6) lamb-over-rice.

#### Hell's Kitchen
- [Golden City - 33rd & 34th st, 9th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-city-chinese-restaurant-new-york) - Chinese Takeout. Affordable chinese takeout in Midtown. It can get busy during lunch hours. Lunch specials are around $6 and comes with a drink. Definitely try out their ($7) Singapore Mei Fun.
- [Riko - 30th & 31st, 8th ave](http://www.yelp.com/biz/riko-peruvian-cuisine-new-york-2) - Peruvian Cuisine. Grab the ($6) half chicken--the meat is very moist and flavorful. I'd skip the rice and beans since the chicken is filling enough.
